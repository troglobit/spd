I want to track and compare simple multicast streams created with ICMP
ping every second.  So inputting several pcap files started at the same
time and output them one packet at a time. 

* Add 1 sec resolution scale
* Add support for reading in multiple pcap files
* Normalize output, only one packet per 1 sec interval, per pcap

=> Comparable output to see where drops occur and streams are joined.
